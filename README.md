# PDF-HTML-Cross-Communication
View able PDFs in HTML allowing cross communication with JS and AcrobatJS for auto filling data and extraction of data in both directions (IE Only, Adobe API Issue) 

## Getting Started

- AdobeJS API only works in Internet Explorer
  - This is an issue with Adobe
- Comment out  GE Centricity CPS Function Libraries in pdfViewer.html to avoid errors.
  - this will function both in (with proper libaries) and out of Centricity.  
- Needs to run on a webserver for AngularJS to work properly.
